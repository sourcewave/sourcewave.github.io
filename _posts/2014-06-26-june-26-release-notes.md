Sharewave roughly breaks down into two halves: documents and ownership. However, we don't really see them as two separate entities. A cap table is a way to view a set of documents. You can't have an entry in a cap table without documentation to back it up -- those 5000 shares don't mean anything without a signed document.

With that in mind, you're now able to tie documents directly to the cap table through Sharewave. Want to see the option agreement for a given employee? It lives right there on your cap table just a click away. We'll soon be providing you with a transaction log so you have full auditability of your cap table from its creation to the present day with all the accompanying documentation.

We're also upgrading our e-signing flow to automatically generate cap table transactions. You'll soon be able to share an options agreement with a new employee, have them sign it through Sharewave and without any further work your cap table will update to include this new transaction.

There are plenty more improvements around Sharewave as well.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Integrations</h2>

We've integrated with dropbox to allow you to much more easily get documents into Sharewave. Just link up your account and we'll create an upload and download folder on dropbox for your company. Drop a file in and we'll put it into your Sharewave library. Want to export a document (or all your documents) from Sharewave to Dropbox - we make that easy too.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Intelligent Upload</h2>
With all these documents heading onto Sharewave we've improved the feedback you get at every step. We run all your documents through our post-processing: if you've scanned the doc so it's slightly skewed and the contrast isn't great we'll clean it up for you! Don't like the results - you can choose to continue with the original.

<h2 style="text-align: left">Debt Note Conversion</h2>
Finally, for any who've ever wondered how on earth convertible debt works <a target="_blank" href="https://sharewave.com/features/convertible-notes">we've created a calculator and visualization for debt notes</a>. This is publicly accessible though if you want interest calculations you'll need to sign up to use our internal tools. We hope this provides an easy route to understanding how convertible debt affects you and your company.
