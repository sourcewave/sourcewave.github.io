Last month we made all our front end code public, this month we've converted to using Github issues so all our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sharewave/frontus/issues?state=open">issues</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sharewave/frontus/issues/milestones">milestones</a> are public too. This means you can see both what we've released and what we're actively working on. Looking through the issues doesn't make for the most comprehensible of overviews however so we've also created <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sharewave/frontus/wiki/Roadmap">a roadmap</a> to give you an idea of when you can expect our more significant new features to be released. None of this is set in stone, some features may come out earlier and some later than expected. If there any particular features you'd love to see on the site sooner than they're currently slated (or if they're not listed at all!) them then please do get in touch, you can also submit issues directly through Github.

Payments went live at the beginning of May so all accounts now need a credit card on file to use Sharewave's full functionality. Customers who haven't paid continue to be able to log in and access their data but they cannot update anything or upload new documents. This also applies to cancelled accounts. This read only mode is only semi-permanent -- we haven't decided on the length yet but within 30-90 days of closing the account you'll lose access to the main site and will only be able to download your data as a zip file (containing all your documents and audit trails as well as the company's captable as a csv).

We've continued to make improvements to how you manage your documents. The latest addition is the tagging of documents. You can add as many "tags" (a tag being one or more words) as you like to each document and then search and filter by these tags. This should make grouping documents far more straightforward. We've also improved how the show/hide functionality works on completed and archived documents.

The other big change that went in the last week was the new navigation. Situated as a thin rail along the left side of the screen, this bar takes up considerably less screen real estate and is also much faster. We now only refresh the whole page when you switch active company, so navigating the site requires much less content to be reloaded considerably lowering page load time. This is only phase one of our navigation redesign which will shift towards giving you a centralized view of your data (for example: one document library with all your documents from all your different companies on one screen).
